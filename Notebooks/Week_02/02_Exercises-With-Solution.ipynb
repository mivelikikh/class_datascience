More precisely, we assumed that the implementation of financial incentives would not affect individuals' morality. In reality, many empirical studies show that the introduction of financial incentives can crowd out moral motives. One of the most famous study is from Gneezy and Rustichini (2000). In a field-study in day-care centers, they have shown that the introduction of a fine for parents arriving late to collect their children significantly increased the number of late-coming parents. Even worse, the effect was not reversible: after the fine was removed, no reduction occurred. Similar effects have been observed for environmental policy, suggesting that putting a price on Nature can lead individuals to leave the \"moral sphere\" towards the \"economic sphere\". In our model, this implies a decrease of the degree of morality. \n",
